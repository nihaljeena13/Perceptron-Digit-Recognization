# Perceptron-Digit-Recognization
Neural networks approach for visual pattern recognition is to take a large number of handwritten digits, known as training examples and then develop a system which can learn from those training examples. 
Also, by increasing the number of training examples the network can learn more about handwriting and improve its accuracy. Neural networks are now so good that they are used by banks to process cheques, and by post offices to recognize addresses

#Perceptron - A perceptron takes several binary inputs, x1,x2,…, and produces a single binary output.
A simple rule to compute the output is by applying weights, w1,w2,…, real numbers expressing the importance of the respective inputs to the output. The neuron's output " 0 or 1 " is determined by whether the weighted sum submition of w(i) * x(i) is less than or greater than some threshold value, where w and x are vectors whose components are the weights and inputs, respectively.
